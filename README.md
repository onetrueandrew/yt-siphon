# YT Siphon
### Redirect YouTube URLs to Alternative Frontends Manually

**YT Siphon** is a browser extension that lets you choose to open YouTube videos in alternative frontends. Instead of auto-redirecting, it gives you the power to decide with simple shortcuts.
**Key Features**:
- **`Alt+J`**: Open the current YouTube video in your chosen frontend.
  - *Tip*: You can customize this shortcut in your browser settings.
- **`Shift+Click`**: While on YouTube, use this to open a video (by clicking on thumbnails / links) in the configured frontend in a new tab.

Perfect for those who like to browse the YouTube homepage and selectively watch videos on alternative frontends. Also handy if someone shares a YouTube link with you and you prefer watching it on a different frontend.

## Motivation
YouTube started cracking down on Ad Blocker usage, so this is my workaround.
